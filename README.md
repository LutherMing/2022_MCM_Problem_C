## Summary
The paper discusses the development of the ITRS Model to maximize economic returns in volatile asset trading, focusing on assets like gold and bitcoin. The model comprises four sub-models: Index Model, Trend Prediction Model, Risk Control Model, and Subject Determination Model. It emphasizes the importance of a well-designed investment portfolio for maximizing returns in a market where bitcoin and gold coexist.

## Key Components
- **Index Model**: Utilizes historical and technical indicators to extract market information effectively.
- **Trend Prediction Model**: Utilizes SVR and LSTM for accurate price forecasting, outperforming traditional methods.
- **Risk Control Model**: Implements Dynamic Position Management to minimize risk and optimize returns from risky assets.
- **Subject Determination Model**: Includes Dual-subject Optimization and Single-subject Optimization for asset allocation based on return and risk considerations.

## Results
Using the ITRS Model and strategy, an initial $1,000 investment on 9/10/2021 would yield $402,287. The paper compares the model with other strategies using metrics like Cumulative Rate of Return, Annualized Rate of Return, Standard Deviation of Daily Returns, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown.





## Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis evaluates the strategy's response to factors such as commission costs, proportion of gold, number of transactions, and final value. The paper also discusses the strength and weaknesses of the models.
